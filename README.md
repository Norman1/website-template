# Website Template

This is an HTML template for text heavy documentation projects suiting my needs. It is a minimalistic and professional
looking design in the form of the holy grail layout.

I made this template with the intention of using it to publish things like guides, technical documentations or my own
CV.

The template can get tested here: https://norman1.github.io/website-template/index.html
